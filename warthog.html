        <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
        <p>Phacochoerus is a genus in the family Suidae, commonly known as warthogs (pronounced wart-hog).
           They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. 
           The two species were formerly considered conspecific under the scientific name Phacochoerus aethiopicus,
            but today this is limited to the desert warthog, while the best-known and most widespread species, 
            the common warthog (or simply warthog), is Phacochoerus africanus.</p>
